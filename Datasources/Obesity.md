## What is Obesity?
Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. It is typically measured using the Body Mass Index (BMI), where a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese.

- Increased sweating
- Snoring
- Difficulty with physical activity

## Causes of Obesity
Obesity is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.

### Genetic Factors
Genetic predisposition can play a significant role in an individual's likelihood of becoming obese.

### Lifestyle Factors
Poor diet, lack of physical activity, and sedentary behavior are major contributors to obesity.

### Medical Conditions
Certain medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), can contribute to weight gain and obesity.

## Prevention Strategies
Preventing obesity involves adopting healthy lifestyle habits and making informed choices.

### Healthy Eating
A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help maintain a healthy weight.

### Regular Physical Activity
Engaging in regular physical activity, such as walking, running, or swimming, can help prevent weight gain and promote overall health.

### Behavioral Changes
Making behavioral changes, such as setting realistic goals, tracking progress, and seeking support, can aid in the prevention of obesity.

## Management Options
Managing obesity involves a combination of medical treatments, nutritional support, and physical activity.

### Medical Management
Medical management may include medications, weight-loss surgery, and other interventions to help reduce body weight.

### Nutritional Support
Nutritional support involves working with a dietitian to develop a personalized eating plan that promotes weight loss and overall health.

### Physical Activity
Incorporating regular physical activity into daily routines can help manage weight and improve health outcomes.

## Managing Obesity
Managing obesity requires long-term commitment and support.

### Long-Term Care
Long-term care may include ongoing medical supervision, regular check-ups, and continuous support to maintain a healthy weight.

### Support and Resources
Access to support groups, counseling, and educational resources can help individuals and families cope with the challenges of obesity.

## Conclusion
